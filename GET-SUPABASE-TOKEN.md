# How to Get Your Supabase Access Token

The token you provided (`ghp_...`) is a GitHub token. For Supabase CLI, we need a **Supabase access token** which starts with `sbp_`.

## Steps to Get Supabase Access Token:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. **Click on your profile/account icon** (top right)
3. **Go to "Account Settings"** or "Access Tokens"
4. **Or go directly to**: https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens
5. **Click "Generate new token"**
6. **Give it a name** (e.g., "HaBet Email Function")
7. **Copy the token** (it will start with `sbp_`)

## Once you have the token:

Share it with me and I'll:
1. Link your project
2. Set your Resend API key (`re_bPrBkG5e_2uwzHqCWkmexL2prijXGTdzr`)
3. Deploy the email function

**Note**: The Supabase access token is different from:
- Your project's anon key (starts with `eyJ...`)
- Your GitHub token (starts with `ghp_`)

It's specifically for CLI operations and starts with `sbp_`.
